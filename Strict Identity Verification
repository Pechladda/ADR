# Title
Strict Identity Verification

## Context
Access control is often overly dependent on existing sessions or network location, for example:
Long-lived tokens that are not strongly bound to devices or context
Requests from new IP addresses, countries, or devices still being accepted
Excessive privileges that are not re-evaluated when risk conditions change


## Decision
Enforce Strict Identity Verification, meaning that each request to a protected resource must be strongly validated:
Use short-lived access tokens with secure refresh mechanisms
Apply step-up authentication (e.g., MFA or biometrics) for high-risk actions
Require re-authentication when risk increases (new device, unusual location, administrative actions)
Bind tokens to audience, scope, device, and session, and validate them on every request

## Rationale
Access should not be treated as permanently granted based on a single login event.
Reduces the impact of token or session hijacking.
Increases confidence that each request truly originates from the same user, the same device, and an acceptable context.

## Consequences
Pros – What becomes easier?
More granular and secure access control, especially for sensitive endpoints.
Better balance between security and user experience through contextual step-up authentication.
Reduced risk of replay attacks and long-term abuse of stolen tokens.
Cons – What becomes more difficult?
Increased user friction due to MFA or step-up challenges under strict policies.
Requires mature risk engines, device binding, and session management.
Integration across SaaS, APIs, and mobile applications becomes more complex.
